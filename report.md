  - use of two routers(one for login, signup and other for rest of the components) did not work properly. I took help of friends, but it took a lot of time as all of them did not want to give up on the issue and kept trying. Finally, I temperoraly fixed the issue and moved on.
  - All of sudden, functions stopped rendering, checked everything, restarted computer but could not find the issue. Finally, tried another browser and it worked with no issue on Opera browser.
